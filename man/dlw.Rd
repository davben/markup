\usage{
dlw(initial_values, data, type = c("cd", "tl"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_values}{A named numeric vector of initial values for the GMM-procedure.}

\item{data}{A data frame of input factors and production output. Variable names need to follow a specific convention, see below.}

\item{type}{A string specifying the type of production function to be estimated, either "cd" for Cobb-Douglas or "tl" for translog.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{optim()} and the moment evaluator function. See Details for more information.}
}
\value{
A list with components (see \code{\link[stats:optim]{stats::optim()}}):
\itemize{
\item \code{par} A vector of best parameter estimates.
\item \code{value} The minimized moment function value.
\item \code{counts} The number of calls to fn and gr.
\item \code{convergence} An integer code. 0 indicates sucessful completion.
\item \code{message} A character string potentially giving additional information.
}
}
\description{
Using the two-stage proxy function approach as described by De Loecker and
Warzynski (2012), based on Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015),
estimate a Cobb-Douglas or translog structural value-added production function.
The sole difference to the \code{acf()}-function is the instrumentation in the second
stage GMM-estimation which also omits the intercept term.
}
\details{
\subsection{Estimation}{

The implemented function uses a third-order polynomial to approximate the Markov process
of productivity growth.
}

\subsection{Initial values}{

The choice of initial values can significantly influence estimation results.
It is recommended to run estimations on a range of combinations of initial values.
Initial values must be provided for each coefficient of the underlying production function.
For a Cobb-Douglas type, this requires two initial values, \code{c(bl = 0.4, bk = 0.6)}.
It is best practice to provide a named vector to avoid unnecessary, and potentially hard to debug mistakes.
Without any names, the estimation routine assumes the order of initial values to be (1) labour,
and (2) capital coefficient.
}

\subsection{Instruments}{

The moment evaluator function by default uses lagged labour as an instrument for labour as well as a constant, capital, and lagged phi.
In order to manually specify the instruments to be used in the GMM-stage, they can be added via the \code{instruments}-argument
as a character vector of variable names which gets passed to the moment function.
For example, adding same-period labour as an instrument is done using \code{instruments = c("l", "l_lag", "k")}
in the \code{dlw()}-function.
}

\subsection{Data}{

Variable names are hard-coded in the estimation procedures of this package and follow conventions in the literature.
Depending on the functional type, the following variables as well as their lags are required (sufficient for Cobb-Douglas in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{y} (log output)
\item \strong{l} (log labour)
\item \strong{k} (log capital)
\item \strong{phi} (fitted value from a first-stage approximation)
\item ll (squared log labour)
\item kk (square log capital)
\item lk (interaction of log labour and log capital)
\item l_lag_k (interaction of lagged log labour and current log capital, no further lag required)
}
